# Accessibility for Horiseon
Objective given was to improve the overall accessability of their website

I achieved this by changing html tags to be semantic wherever possible, updating the relative CSS tags, and adding alts to images .

There were no semantic tags around the main content of the page, only div, p and other basics. 
I replaced what I could with tags like header, footer, nav, figure, figcaption, section, and aside.
I also noticed the title was empty, so I added a description so that the title would display a consice description of the webpage.

None of the img tags contained any alt descriptions, so I did my best to describe each image for accessibility. 

The .CSS was mostly sound. I made a few changes to make sure that the inteded design remained intact after changning most of the .html tags. I also reordered a few sections to match the flow of the .html, and added comments to seperate each section.

Also changed a section of the footer that was tagged h2 to h4 to make more sense semantically.

The main content was provided by the client; design, images, text, links. 
My job was soley to maximize accessibility.

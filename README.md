Accessibility for Horiseon
===========================================
### (Homework for week one of bootcamp)

Objective given was to improve the overall accessability of their website

This involved putting semantic html tags wherever possible, updating the relative CSS tags, adding alts to images, and making sure that the site was functioning fully as intended.

There were no semantic tags around the main content of the page, only div, p and other basics. 
I replaced what I could with tags like header, footer, nav, figure, figcaption, section, and aside.
I also noticed the title was empty, so I added a description so that the title would display a consice description of the webpage.
Added tabindex to all of the readable content, so that it would be accessable to a screen reader
None of the img tags contained any alt descriptions, so I did my best to describe each image for accessibility. 

The .CSS was mostly sound. I renamed a few of the selectors to make sure that the inteded design remained intact after changning most of the .html tags. This also involved deleting a few redundant lines and consolidating them into one. Lastly, I reordered a few sections to match the flow of the .html, and added comments to seperate each section.

Also changed a section of the footer that was tagged h2 to h4 to make more sense semantically.

The main content was provided by the client; design, images, text, links. 
My job was soley to maximize accessibility.
